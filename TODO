- Have distance compute color relative to distance calculated from
  cmpl-w/cmplx-h rather than amplification
- By default create <algoname.gif> only display if the --preview flag is
  showing

Major:
- Create logging framework with multiple levels
- Testing framework!

Ideas:
- Create histogram (and display it using testing) and use that to
  determine when to use distance method, and when to use iteration 
  escape with smooth. The idea is for the white valleys, use iteration
  escape with smoothing. Should be pretty apparent in the histogram ..

  Perhaps do CDF and choose when second derivative is 0?
 

DONE
- Set detault params that make sense per algo
