- Have distance compute color relative to distance calculated from
  cmpl-w/cmplx-h rather than amplification
- By default create <algoname.gif> only display if the --preview flag is
  showing
- Fix caching to be in the algos
    - Partway there. Need to include algo specific stuff in the hash
      (e.g. julia_c)

Major:

- Testing framework!

DONE
