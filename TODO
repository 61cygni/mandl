- Have distance compute color relative to distance calculated from
  cmpl-w/cmplx-h rather than amplification
- By default create <algoname.gif> only display if the --preview flag is
  showing

Major:
- Create logging framework with multiple levels
- Testing framework!

Ideas:
- Create histogram (and display it using testing) and use that to
  determine when to use distance method, and when to use iteration 
  escape with smooth. The idea is for the white valleys, use iteration
  escape with smoothing. Should be pretty apparent in the histogram ..

  Perhaps do CDF and choose when second derivative is 0?
 
- Sample multiple points per pixel and plot the average. This should
  smooth out some of the pixelation you see in the iteration escape
  method. Maybe do 1/2 the distance between pixels?
  -- This does't seem to work. It's just too chaotic underneath. 
     should try with a bunch of random points just for kicks

- Should implement keyframes to get better fidelity. Basically just
  super high res frames you use scaling to zoom into, until you hit
  another keyframe

DONE
- Set detault params that make sense per algo
